			<p>Hi! I'm Ian, a Level 3 Sports Massage Therapist. After 30+ years of working in the packaging industry, it's time for a change of direction! I took up running about 9 years ago and have completed a number of marathons, half marathons, mud runs and obstacle course races in that time. I'm also a member of The Malvern Joggers, who I've run with for the last 5 or 6 years. Still working full time at the moment and fitting the Sports Massage in around that, so I'm currently available for massage after 17:00 Mon - Thurs, after 12:00 on Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday.</p>
